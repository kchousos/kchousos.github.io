Have started my [MSc program](http://alma.di.uoa.gr/) in theoretical computer science. Currently I study algorithms, cryptography, graph theory and computational complexity. So far it's very interesting, although -- as expected -- a bit challenging.

### Working on

### Reading

- **The Catcher in the Rye**, J.D. Salinger

Nothing currently, too busy 😛.
