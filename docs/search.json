    "text": "About me\nI recently finished my undergraduate studies at the Department of Informatics and Telecommunications of the University of Athens. For the last semester I was working on my thesis under the guidance of prof. Thanassis Avgerinos. I am also working on the RECITALS EU project, as part of prof. Manolis Koubarakis’ team.\nI am mainly interested in AI and its applications, software security and cryptography. Miscellaneous interests of mine include functional programming, typesetting/\\LaTeX, Linux systems, human-computer interaction and CS-adjacent mathematics.\nAside from computer science, my second passion is music. I play classical guitar, in which I acquired a diploma in January of 2023 from the national conservatory of Greece. I am also a member of the Vox Fortis choir, with appearances in places such as the Athens Concert Hall and the Odeon of Herodes Atticus.\nLastly, I’m currently re-learning to draw, following the DrawABox course. I’ve been making progress and I look forward to improving my drawing skills furthermore. I used to draw a lot during primary school, and I was quite good at it too. So. I’m excited to get back at it."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Updating your BIOS is often perceived as a straightforward task. You run an .exe file, you wait a minute or two, your screen flashes and poof, you’re done. This at least is the Lenovo Experience™ with their BIOS update wizards.\nBut what if your laptop is running Linux? Then the only way to use these .exe files would be to dual boot with a Windows partition. Unfortunately, this is not acceptable for most.\nThe easiest solution I came to find was instead of using a normal Windows installation, I could run the update from a live CD Windows image, specifically Hiren’s BootCD PE. From their homepage:\n\nHiren’s BootCD PE (Preinstallation Environment) is a restored edition of Hiren’s BootCD based on Windows 11 PE x64. Given the absence of official updates after November 2012, the PE version is currently under development by the fans of Hiren’s BootCD. It includes a carefully chosen set of the best free tools, designed for modern computers that support UEFI booting and need at least 4 GB of RAM.\n\nIt is a very interesting project and one that in my case came in very handy. The only problem I faced was that the laptop wouldn’t connect to Wi-Fi and thus I wasn’t able to download the .exe file. My solution was copying the update executable to another USB from which I transferred it to the live image. Simply executing the file worked correctly and the update was successful!\nHope this short post will be helpful to anyone facing a similar problem :).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0CitationBibTeX citation:@online{chousos2024,\n  author = {Chousos, Konstantinos},\n  title = {BIOS Update for {Lenovo} Laptop on {Linux}},\n  date = {2024-12-25},\n  url = {https://kchousos.github.io/posts/Lenovo BIOS Linux.html},\n  langid = {en}\n}"
