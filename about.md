Hello, welcome to my personal site!

My name is Konstantinos Chousos. I am an AI/Security researcher, member of the [UoA AI team](https://ai.di.uoa.gr/).

## About me

I recently finished my undergraduate studies at the [Department of Informatics and Telecommunications](https://www.di.uoa.gr/en) of the [University of Athens](https://en.uoa.gr/). For the last semester I was working on my [thesis](https://kchousos.github.io/BSc-Thesis/) under the guidance of prof. [Thanassis Avgerinos](https://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~thanassis/). I am also working on the [RECITALS EU project](https://recitals-project.eu/), as part of prof. [Manolis Koubarakis'](https://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~koubarak/) team.

I am mainly interested in AI and its applications, software security and cryptography. Miscellaneous interests of mine include functional programming, typesetting/$\LaTeX$, Linux systems, human-computer interaction and CS-adjacent mathematics.

Aside from computer science, my second passion is music. I play classical guitar, in which I acquired a [diploma in January of 2023](https://youtu.be/Ca1J-dLcY44?si=NhWsm8AFgrS_dYx4) from the national conservatory of Greece. I am also a member of the [Vox Fortis choir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJvTAZme7-I), with appearances in places such as the Athens Concert Hall and the Odeon of Herodes Atticus.

Lastly, I'm currently re-learning to draw, following the [DrawABox](https://drawabox.com) course. I've been making progress and I look forward to improving my drawing skills furthermore. I used to draw a lot during primary school, and I was quite good at it too. So. I'm excited to get back at it.
